## 🌍 Problem Statement

Homelessness in India is increasing at an alarming rate. Many individuals and families are forced to live on the streets due to:

- Abuse or abandonment  
- Financial instability  
- Long-term unemployment  
- Lack of affordable housing  

Access to **healthcare** remains extremely limited for homeless individuals because of:

- Absence of identification documents  
- High medical costs  
- Bias or denial of treatment by institutions  

Children living on the streets are particularly vulnerable to:

- Human trafficking  
- Forced labor  
- Physical and emotional abuse  

There is an urgent need for a unified and accessible platform that provides immediate support and guidance.

🛡️ StreetSafe – A Support Platform for Homeless Individuals

A web application designed to assist homeless individuals by helping them locate nearby shelter homes, hospitals, and legal/helpline services, while spreading awareness about the growing homelessness crisis in India.

🌍 Problem Statement :

Homelessness in India is rapidly rising. Many individuals are forced to sleep on streets and work under harsh conditions. Children, too, are increasingly found living on streets due to:

Abuse or abandonment

Financial instability at home

Long-term unemployment

Lack of affordable housing


Access to healthcare is extremely limited for the homeless due to :

Lack of identification documents
High expenses
Bias or direct refusal from medical institutions
Children on the streets often face trafficking, forced labor, and violence — creating an urgent need for a supportive platform.

💡 Purpose of StreetSafe :

StreetSafe aims to bridge the gap by offering homeless individuals and volunteers a simple platform to:
Locate nearby shelter homes
Find nearest hospitals
Access legal aid and verified helpline numbers
View a curated list of essential survival items

This app can be used by:
